# Motivation

Do you know that feeling, when you try to generate Typescript types from API, but the type generator

❌ requires you to install some Java files on your machine

❌ is hard to integrate in your project

❌ doesn't handle your complex types

❌ is slowly generating whole folder structure

❌ can't handle nullable types or enums

...

✅ And that's why REST2TS was created.

✅ REST2TS generates whole api into one file. Let's keep it simple.

✅ Generates complex return type, handles nullability and enums.

✅ Generates types for Angular with HttpClient and RxJS.
